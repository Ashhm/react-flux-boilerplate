# react-flux-boilerplate
## About
We can find a lot of implementation of Facebook Flux pattern on GitHub, for example: Reflux, Fluxxxor, Redux etc. 
This plate was created to show the original idea of Facebook Flux technology. 
For this project developing I used ES6 syntax, created universal Webpack configuration and added LESS pre-processor.
